            <h3>Personal and Sensitive Information</h3>

            <p>
              Personal Information means and includes all information that can
              be linked to a specific individual or to identify any individual,
              such as name, address, mailing address, telephone number, e – mail
              address, credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date,
              information about the bookings, and any and all details that may
              be requested while any customers visits or uses the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you have consented to Collative use of “sensitive” Personal
              Information, which is used to uniquely identify you within the
              meaning of Information Technology (Reasonable security practices
              and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) (Rules,
              2011) (“Sensitive Personal Information”), you are able to withdraw
              that consent at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prior to disclosing Sensitive Personal Information to a third
              party or Processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its
              original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the
              Data Subject, Collative will endeavour to obtain your explicit
              consent (opt-in). Where your consent for the Processing of
              Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract,
              Collative will comply with the law or contract.

              In addition, we store certain information from your browser using
              “cookies.” The Website uses cookie and tracking technology
              depending on the features offered. We use data collection devices
              such as “cookies” on certain pages of the Website to help analyse
              our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote
              trust and safety. “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard
              drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain
              features that are only available using a “cookie”.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less
              frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide
              information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are
              “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted
              from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free
              to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that
              case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website
              and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently
              during a session.

            <p>
              Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other similar devices
              on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties.
              We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

              First and foremost, you can rest assured that no personally
              identifiable information (“PII”) about you (e.g., name, address,
              etc.) is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the Website
              and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.

            <p>
              A cookie may also be placed by our advertising server. Such
              cookies are used only for purposes of tracking the effectiveness
              of advertising served by us on our Website and no PII is gathered
              from you using these cookies, nor is this information shared with
              any third parties. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third
              – party advertising companies or advertisement providers or
              servers. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your
              visits to this and other websites in order to provide
              advertisements about work space – related goods and services that
              you may be interested in or any goods and services of potential
              interest to you. The information they collect does not include
              your PII.
            </p>

            <p>
              The third – party advertising companies or advertisement providers
              may also employ technology that is used to measure the
              effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous. They may
              use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other
              sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
              of potential interest to you. No PII is collected during this
              process. The information is anonymous and does not link online
              actions to an identifiable person. If you would like more
              information and want to explore the option of not having this
              information collected by third – party advertisers.

              Collative will not collect, transmit or otherwise use this
              information without your permission. We use location data to

              your location through your privacy settings. To opt out of
              location tracking, please change your settings at the device

            <h3>Use of Information Obtained by Collative</h3>

            <p>
              Once you register with Collative, you may create your Profile.
              Your Profile information, as well as your contact information, are
              displayed to other Users. We may occasionally use your contact
              information to send you notifications regarding new services
              offered by Collative and its partners that we think you may find
              valuable. Collative may also send you service-related
              announcements from time to time through the general operation of
              the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails by
              following the unsubscribe option included in each email, although
              Collative reserves the right to send you notices about your
              account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Profile information and your reservation activity is used by
              Collative primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when
              you access the Service. In some cases, other Users may be able to
              supplement your Profile or contribute information about your Venue
              (if you are a Venue Owner), including by submitting comments and
              reviews. You consent to Collative making such information
              available to other Users and the public. You may change the
              privacy settings of your profile through your account portal.
              Information from your Profile may be available to our third party
              service provider for search engines. This is primarily so that
              potential users may be able to find you.
            </p>

            <h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>

            <p>
              You may choose to provide information about you, your company or
              organization or, if you are a Venue Owner, your Venue to other
              Users and to the public by providing such information on public
              areas of the Site (“Public Information”). Public Information
              consists of information that is posted by you on areas of the Site
              accessible by other Users and/or the public, such as Venue
              descriptions. Public information does not include information you
              submit to us but do not post on areas of the Site accessible by
              other Users and/or the public, such as billing and payment
              information (“Non-Public Information”).
            </p>

            <p>
              We will share your personal information with third parties only in
              the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell
              your personal information to third parties. We share your
              Non-Public Information with third parties only in limited
              circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably
              necessary to offer the Service, legally required or, permitted by
              you. For example:
            </p>
            <p>
              We may provide Non-Public Information to service providers who
              help us bring you the services we offer, such as hosting the
              service at a co-location facility, sending email updates about
              Collative, removing repetitive information from our User lists,
              processing payments, or to provide search results or links. In
              connection with these offerings and business operations, our
              service providers may have access to your Non-Public Information
              for use for a limited time in connection with these business
              activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of
              any of your Non-Public Information, we implement reasonable
              contractual protections limiting the use of that Non-Public
              Information to the provision of services to Collative.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to the circumstances described above , Collative may
              disclose the website member information if required to do so by
              the law, court order, as requested by other government or law
              enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure
              is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation,
              to protect the rights or properties of Collative or any or all of
              its affiliates, associates, employees, directors or officers or
              when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is
              necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
              someone who may be causing interference with our rights or
              properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone
              else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if Collative
              or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer
              information will most likely also be transferred in connection
              with such acquisition.
            </p>

            <p>
              We and our affiliates will share/ sell some or all of your
              personal information with another business entity should we (or
              our assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business
              entity, or re-organisation, amalgamation, restructuring of
              business. Should such a transaction occur that other business
              entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow
