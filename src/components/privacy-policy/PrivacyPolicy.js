                  <p>
                    Our buildings and facilities have CCTV installed to meet our
                    legitimate business interests in protecting the safety of
                    Our employees, members, and guests and their property. These

                    footage available to members and other third parties
                    authorized by us. These recordings may be shared with
                    competent authorities in accordance with applicable laws, if
                    required. The recordings are generally retained for a
                    limited period of time but may be kept longer where We or an
                    applicable member determines that it is appropriate, for
                    example in connection with the investigation of an incident,
                    or when competent authorities request us to retain them.

                  <p>
                    Our CCTV practices are based on an assessment of the data
                    protection interests of affected data subjects against our
                    legitimate interests. This may entail consideration, for
                    example, of the likelihood and impact of unlawful or
                    impermissible conduct on our communities and expectations of
                    privacy in particular facilities or spaces that may be
                    subject to CCTV. The recordings are generally retained for a
                    limited period of time in accordance with Section 9 of this
                    Global Privacy Policy.
