            comment: "I have been a regular visitor at Collative co-working space for the past few months. Few things that really standout for me are the super-friendly staff here, the cleanliness of the place, noise-less environment to work in, with a decent WiFi speed that works without interruption. Other benefits that I like include convenient free parking, good coffee machine and small nearby eateries. Overall, I find the Saket location very nice as it is in a green and pollution free area of Saket and its always nice to go out for a walk or get some sun in and around the building area.",

            comment: "Our team of 10 people has been working out of Collative for the last six months and it has been a great experience. The staff - everyone from the parking attendant, security guards, pantry staff to the IT support, and operations support - are warm, welcoming and make each day both pleasant and productive and are very responsive to customer requests. The bright, vibrant space is arguably the best in South Delhi, and the technology has made our many video calls with global teams seamless. The management team has been great and is able to work across different constraints. We have had a great experience and would highly recommend Collative to anyone looking for a sophisticated co-working experience",
